# LUSTAVIA NETWORK DApp

This decentralized application (DApp) allows you to interact with an Ethereum smart contract to deposit and withdraw Ether (ETH). It also tracks your transaction history for transparency.

## Features

- Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the DApp.
- View your account balance and transaction history.
- Deposit and withdraw 1 ETH with the click of a button.

## Setup 

1. **MetaMask Wallet:** Ensure you have MetaMask installed in your browser. You can download it from [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

2. **Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

(I personally ran this using VS code but use whatever feels correct.)
